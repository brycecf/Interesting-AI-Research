# Interesting AI Research & Best Practices
Markdown document for keeping track of AI research that I find interesting or important.

### Best Practices
+ ["Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering"](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf)
  + Author
    + Martin Zinkevich, Google Research Scientist
  + Why we read this?
    + Discusses best practices for machine learning at Google in the format of a style guide. However, these recommendations should definitely be taken with a grain of salt (remember that this is a guide for Google product development with machine learning). I have very strong reservations about applying some of these rules within a high-stakes domain (e.g. defense applications).
